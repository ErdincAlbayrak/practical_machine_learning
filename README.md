Predicting Weight Lifting Exercises from Wearable Technology

Overview

In this report, I have used the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset which is generated from wearable technology
to predict how the activities performed. The activity was one set of Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl but in
5 different ways. As a result, we have a classification problem with 5 classes.

Pre-Processing, validation, model selection and Accuracy was performed as per machine learning good practices.
